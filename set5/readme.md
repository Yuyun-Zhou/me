TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

In this week, we learnt how to use recurtion to make fancy thing. Use function to refactor codes and use recurtion to simplify the algorithm will be a really useful skill for programming in python.

I'm interested in the usage of the revuesion in the algorithm. Learn a lot by myself
about the dynamic programming. Some famous algorithm that can be run to find the shortest cost
path in a graph contained negative edges all use the idea of dynamic programming, which
heavily used the idea of recursion.

Cheers :D

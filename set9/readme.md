TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week I start analysis the crash distribution locations in NSW. I use
geographic data, the graph data is coming from the NSW government. It seems
like the eastern residential area of the NSW has more crashes. I will dig deeper using crash per thousands people, which can reveal the traffic situation
of the NSW from my perspectives.

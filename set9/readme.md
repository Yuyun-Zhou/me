TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This week I start analyze the crash distribution locations in NSW. I use
geographic data, the graph data is coming from the NSW government. It seems
like the eastern residential area of the NSW has more crashes. I will dig deeper using crash per thousands people, which can reveal the traffic situation of the NSW.

Some district may have more crashed just because that district has more populations lived in, which in the end results in a higher traffic numbers with crash numbers. I will also use the population number released
by NSW government in 2022 to analyze the traffic situation around sydney central areas, and these information will finilly be presented as a heat-map.

Cheers! :D

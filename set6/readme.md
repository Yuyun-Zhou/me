TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

In this week, I learned how to write and draw graph in the python notebook.

Do some histogram analysis to the data set I choose.

The data set I choose is the crash data of the NSW in between 2018 - 2020.

The interesting stuff I'd like to dig into is the "time", "location", and "which car is safer."

Cheers :D

TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

Hi, I'm Yuyun. :)
In this week, I spent lots of time to understand how to use pip, which is python package management
command, in the terminal to install all packages required in the requirement.txt.
I also play a lot with teh git commands like pull, add, commit, and push.
These are really interesting.
Looking forward to learn more in this term!
Also, by following the guideline, I also print my name in trinket, the link is below:

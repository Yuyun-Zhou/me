TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

In this week, I further improve my data project by showing the crashes in the boundary of each district. It is interesting to see that actually high percentages of crashes located in these boundary. I will have some further investment to why we have this result.

On the other hand, we also learn how to make a presentation on python notebook using RISE. Have already finished some slides toward the presentation.

In conclusion, feel pretty well for this course. Learn a lot about the python and
how to do the data analysis and visualization in the python notebook. Will further improve any other details in the labbook before the presentation.

Thank you for reading my lab book, cheers! :)

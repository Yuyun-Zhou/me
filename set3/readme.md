TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
In this week, we learn a lot of basic algorithms. I also discover more by myself, i.e, slide-window algorithm,
merge sort, BFS, and DFS.
Start to think around the interesting data set for the assignment. Aim to dig into interesting details on
some common things in our life, 
i.e: 
1. connection between water and alcoho? 
2. connection between crash and location?
3. or any connection between exam score and unsw term?

(PS: Abandon the third topic at the end of this week... Seems like unsw dont release the exam scores in details for every term... May focus on the 2nd topic since it seems to be more interesting to
me.)

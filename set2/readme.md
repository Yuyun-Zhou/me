TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.


In this week, I first learn if/while loop. 
-> We also learned about different types of brackets used in programming. (i.e: {Curly braces} are used for defining dictionaries and sets, while [square brackets] are used for lists and indexing into collections.)

-> We learned how to append elements into a list. Use for loop to keep pushing items into it. And how
to return things for a function.

-> We also know the importance of the difference between int and string. Therefore if we want to append
element like integer 1 into a string list, we have to first transfer it to string. (str(1))

Some important programming words:
Argument: A value passed to a function or method when calling it.
Return: Send back a value to the caller function.
Caller: The function which call another function.
Callee: The function which has been called by the caller.
Function: A block of code that performs a specific task.
List: A collection of items, defined as []

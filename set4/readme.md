TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
In this week, we have learnt how to load data from the json and solve relavent issure.
I found that lots of dataset require to use json. So learn how to load data from json is
important and rewarding for me.

For my dataproject, I learn how to load the data from json effectively. Also thinking around the
issue that if the local json file is missed, how the user can still run my data project.

I decide to store the data in my online google drive, so that if someone missed the data, the
project can still run successfully. It spent me lots of time to make it work, but in overall, is very rewarding.

I will use this to load the data for my open-data project after I decide to use which data set.

cheers! :D

TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

In this week, I finished the heatmap construction for my data project. This means
my second interesting stuff is complete. I use the heat map to
show the crash between different vehicles. And figure out that
public transportation is safer, and the car is the most popular
method among people for going out.

Interestingly, mini-bike is the most safe vehicle in NSW.

Cheers! :D

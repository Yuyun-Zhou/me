TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

In this week, I finished the time analysis of the dataset. I found that more weekdays
fatal evens compared to weekends, and more weekends fatal carsh event.

I believe it is because more people consume alcohoe in weekend and in the end, this results in a higher
number of casaulty fatal crash in the weekend.

Some more datails around this analysis will be shown in the notebook, but overall, all goods.

Cheers! :D

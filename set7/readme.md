TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

In this week, I finished the time analysis of the dataset. I found that fatal events happened in weekends.
And the timeframe of different fatal events for weekdays and weekends are seems to be different.

I believe it is because more people consume alcohoe in weekend and in the end, this results in a higher
number of casaulty fatal crash in the weekend.

I will dig deeper toward this topic since I think this is really interesting!

Some more datails around this analysis will be shown in the notebook, but overall, all goods.

Cheers! :D
